## TweakMecha

A basic config mod that allows you to tweak your mecha.  Currently allows you to increase the maximum warp speed and cruise speed of the Icarus Mecha.

Note: If you're used to crashing into planets from warp and having the game exit you, this may not be possible due to the speed of approach.  
As such, it's recommended to exit warp when you're close enough to the planet and sail the rest of the way.
